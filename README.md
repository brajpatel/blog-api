# Blog API
This project was made for The Odin Project's [Blog API Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api) and works in conjunction with the [Blog Client](https://github.com/brajpatel/blog-client). The main objectives of this project were:
- to separate the front and back-end
- to set up an API that could be accessed from outside (I.e. from the Blog Client)

You can check out the Blog Client by clicking [here](https://github.com/brajpatel/blog-client).
